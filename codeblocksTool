Executable avrdude

Parameters
-p m328p -c arduino  -P /dev/ttyUSB0 -U flash:w:$(PROJECT_DIR)bin/Debug/$(PROJECT_NAME).hex:i
-p m328p -c arduino  -P com4 -U flash:w:$(PROJECT_DIR)bin/Debug/$(PROJECT_NAME).hex:i

microchip/atmel studio 
windows sometimes accepts avrdude.exe other times need to locate and set

diff pc's assign diff port numbers

nano
-p m328p -c arduino -P  com3 -b 57600  -U flash:w:$(BinDir)\$(TargetName).hex:i

uno
-p m328p -c arduino -P com4  -U flash:w:$(BinDir)\$(TargetName).hex:i



avra from simulide
put avra.exe + Blink.asm + folder of definitions named avra

so
avra -W NoRegDef -l Blink.lst -I avra Blink.asm
avra -W NoRegDef -I avra Blink.asm
avra -I avra Blink.asm

does work because I moved a folder called avra containing 50 definitions
- Blink.lst generates a duplicate of m328pdef.inc
